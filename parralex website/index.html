            <h2 class="sec">ABOUT CRICKET</h2>


            <p class="text">Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the center of which is a 22-yard (20-meter) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler, delivers (i.e., bowls) the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, with the aim of getting a batsman out. The batsman, who is on strike at the wicket (batting end), defends the wicket from the ball delivered by the bowler, and if the ball is hit, the batsmen may become "runners" who must run back and forth between the wickets to score runs. Runs are scored either by hitting the ball and running or by hitting the ball to the boundary in such a way that the batsmen do not need to run, and the runs are automatically added to the team's score. When ten batsmen have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.</p>
